## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Sarath**, a Full-Stack Developer based in **India**.

I build things that interest me.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll try to build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is **JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Java, Spring Boot**.  
I enjoy working on full-stack web applications and learning backend architecture.

I've got a few pinned projects below — those represent what I’m currently capable of.

If you want to see more of my work, feel free to explore my repositories.
